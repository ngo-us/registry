# NGO.US Domain Registry - Important Update

This GitHub repository is no longer used for domain registrations. Please visit our official website for the new registration process:

## For Existing Domain Holders

If you already have a .ngo.us domain registered through the previous GitHub process, your domain will continue to work. However, all future renewals and updates must be processed through the new system.

Thank you for your interest in the NGO.US Registry. We look forward to continuing to support nonprofit organizations with their domain needs.
